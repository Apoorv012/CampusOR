**Geo Queue Entry Verification**

Type 
Security

Basically the students can directlty join the queue from any location, This leads to a check
of geo that compares the user's current GPS current GPS coordinates against the physical
coordinates of the campus or any particular place

why this needed?

Reduce "Wrong" Queuing: Prevents users from joining a queue from hostel which creates artificial
wait timea
